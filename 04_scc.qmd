BU's Shared Computing Cluster (SCC) is heterogeneeous Linux cluster composed of both _Shared_ and _Buy-in_ nodes.

Currently:

* Over 12,000 shared CPU cores
* Over 17,000 buy-in CPU cores
* Over 500 GPUs
* 16 Petabytes of storage

CDS has buy-in nodes.

The easiest way to get to a terminal session on the Shared Computing Cluster (SCC)
is to navigate to [SCC On Demand](https://scc-ondemand.bu.edu).

The nodes you see on the list are the **login nodes**.


:::
::::

* You are restricted from running computation workloads on the login nodes.
* Use them for simple file access and to submit jobs to the queue system.
* Heavy computation processes will be killed after a few (15?) minutes.
* Heavy computation processes should be run on the **compute nodes** via the 
  queueing system or from interactive sessions.

## SSH Connection to SCC Login Nodes

You can also `ssh` to the login nodes:

* `<username>@scc1.bu.edu` or 
* `<username>@scc2.bu.edu` or
* `<username>@scc3.bu.edu `

 The first time you `ssh`, you might get the message a like this with `scc1`:

```
The authenticity of host 'scc2.bu.edu (192.12.187.131)' can't be established.
ED25519 key fingerprint is SHA256:OmvL4FQ48QTpcXDpYE63rse1tM6pfKfSUgaVW1+mlIw.
This key is not known by any other names.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])? 
```

Just type yes and hit `return`.

## Connect to Login Node

Let's connec to a login node.,

You'll start in your home directory.

```bash
$ pwd
/usr2/faculty/tgardos
```
You can show the processes you're running with `ps`.

```bash
$ ps
    PID TTY          TIME CMD
3507536 pts/328  00:00:00 bash
3518333 pts/328  00:00:00 ps
```

Which says you are running the `bash` shell and also the `ps` command.
:::
::::

## Updating your prompt

As we showed before, you can update your prompt to show the current working directory
and the current git branch (if you're in a git repository).

Add the following lines to the end of your `.bashrc` file:

```bash
parse_git_branch() {
     git branch 2> /dev/null | sed -e '/^[^*]/d' -e 's/* \(.*\)/(\1)/'
}
export PS1="\[\e[32m\]\w \[\e[91m\]\$(parse_git_branch)\[\e[00m\]$ "
```
Then either exit and restart your terminal or just run `source ~/.bashrc` this
time.

## SCC Group Membership

We're in a shared computing environment, so we have to be careful about
group membership and file permissions.

You'll be a member of a group for every project or class you're in on SCC.

To see what groups you're in, you can use the `groups` command:

```bash
~ $ groups
sparkgrp ds549 ds549-ta ds598 ds598ta herbdl ai-tutor spareit
```

The above are all the groups I'm in.

But you have to be pay attention to what your current **default group** is.

You can see what your default group is with the `id` command:

```bash
~ $ id
uid=426625(tgardos) gid=363482(sparkgrp) groups=363482(sparkgrp),430422(ds549),430527(ds549-ta),450171(ds598),450177(ds598ta),450334(herbdl),450346(ai-tutor),450373(spareit)
```

This shows my user ID (uid) and my default group ID (gid) which is currently `sparkgrp`.

Most of you will likely be in the `dl4ds` group. 

If you just want to _just_ see your default group, you can use the command:

```bash
~ $ id -ng
sparkgrp
```

## Why does default group matter?

Remember back in [01_command_shells.qmd](01_command_shells.qmd#ls----list-directory-contents) we talked about
file permissions?

To recap, with the `ls -l` command I showed you:

```sh
$ ls -al
total 2
drwxr-sr-x 3 tgardos ds549 4096 Sep  6  2023 .
drwxr-s--- 9 root    ds549 4096 Jan 26  2023 ..
drwxr-sr-x 9 tgardos ds549 4096 Apr  9 12:35 tgardos
```

The file permissions are a string of 10 characters. The first character is
the file type. The next 9 characters are the file permissions in triplets
corresponding to the user, group, and other permissions.

In each triplet, the first character is the read permission, the second character
is the write permission, and the third character is the execute permission. If
there is `-` in the triplet, it means the permission is not granted.

If there is a `@` at the end of the line, it means the file has extended
attributes.

```
             group permissions
        file type    |    extended attributes
                |   ---   |
                drwxr-xr-x@
                 ---   ---
                  |     |
                  |       other/world permissions
                  user permissions
```

When you are collaborating with others:

* You have to make sure you give `r/w` permissions to the group.
* You have to make sure the file or directory is owned by the right group

To change my group to `ds549`, I can use the `newgrp` command:

```bash
$ newgrp ds549

$ id -ng
ds549
```

## To Change File or Directory Permissions

From my home directory, I'll create a directory and change into it:

```bash
~ $ mkdir tempdir
~ $ cd tempdir
~/tempdir $ ls -al
total 1
drwxr-xr-x  2 tgardos sparkgrp 4096 Sep 10 13:03 .
drwx------ 40 tgardos sparkgrp 4096 Sep 10 13:03 ..
```

I'll create a file and check ownership and permissions:

```bash
~/tempdir $ touch file1.txt
~/tempdir $ ls -l
total 0
-rw-r--r-- 1 tgardos sparkgrp 0 Sep 10 13:03 file1.txt
```

See that it created a file with my default group `sparkgrp`.

```bash
~/tempdir $ id -ng
sparkgrp
```

Now, I'll change the group permissions of the file:

```bash
~/tempdir $ chmod g+w file1.txt 
~/tempdir $ ls -l
total 0
-rw-rw-r-- 1 tgardos sparkgrp 0 Sep 10 13:03 file1.txt
```

Let's change my default group to `ds549`:

```bash
~/tempdir $ newgrp ds549
~/tempdir $ id -ng
ds549
```
Now let's create another file and check ownership and permissions:

```bash
~/tempdir $ touch file2.txt
~/tempdir $ ls -l
total 0
-rw-rw-r-- 1 tgardos sparkgrp 0 Sep 10 13:03 file1.txt
-rw-r--r-- 1 tgardos ds549    0 Sep 10 13:07 file2.txt
```

See that I have files from both groups. People in `sparkgrp` can read and write
to `file1.txt` and people in `dl4ds` can read from file2.txt.

## SCC Projects

You won't want to do much work in your home directory.

For starters you have limited storage quota.

```bash
$ quota -s
Home Directory Usage and Quota:
Name           GB    quota    limit in_doubt    grace |    files    quota    limit in_doubt    grace
tgardos   7.64500     10.0     11.0      0.0     none |   86,169  200,000  200,000       19     none
```

Check my current default group:

```bash
$ id -ng
sparkgrp
```

You should each be in the `dl4ds` project.

```bash
~ $ cd /projectnb/dl4ds
/projectnb/dl4ds $ ls
admin  archive  datasets  materials  projects  README.md  students  workspaces
```

You each have a dedicated working directory in `students`.

```bash
/projectnb/ds549 $ cd students

/projectnb/ds549/students $ ls
... // list of student directories
```

::: {.callout-important}
Super important point. If you are ever collaborating on a project,
you each should be working on your own copy of the project
repo in your own working directory. Use **GitHub** for asynchronous collaboration.

Never simultaneously edit the same files on SCC.

## SCC GitHub Exercise

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="60%"}
![](./assets/images/04_scc/github-ml-549-course.png){width="90%"}
:::
::: {.column width="40%"}
Let's do a quick exercise to get you comfortable with using GitHub from SCC.

Navigate to [https://github.com/trgardos/shell-scc-python](https://github.com/trgardos/shell-scc-python).

Fork the repo to your GitHub account.

:::

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
![](./assets/images/04_scc/github-ml-549-course2.png){width="90%"}
:::
::: {.column width="50%"}

Navigate to `/projectnb/dl4ds/students/<your-username>`.

Clone the repo to your working directory.

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/trgardos/shell-scc-python.git

$ cd shell-scc-python
$ git remote -v
```
:::
::::

Now let's create a new branch and make some changes.

```bash
$ git checkout -b my-new-branch
```

If you updated your `.bashrc` you should see your branch in the prompt.

```bash
$ touch my-new-file.txt
$ git add my-new-file.txt
$ git commit -m "Add my new file"
$ git push origin my-new-branch
```

Now if you wanted, you can create a pull request from your branch in your forked
repo back to the main repo.
